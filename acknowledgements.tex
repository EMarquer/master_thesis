%The acknowledgments and the people to thank go here, don't forget to include your project advisor\ldots

First, I would like to express my gratitude to Miguel Couceiro and Ajinkya Kulkarni, my supervisors, for the time they have spent on my internship.
I am particularly grateful for their patient advice and their ideas without which this project wouldn't have existed.
I also wish to thank Alain Gely and Alexandre Bazin who lent their expertise in FCA and helped making BoA a reality.
Many thanks to all of them for their friendliness which made this internship such a nice experience.

A very special gratitude to all the members of Orpailleur, Semagramme and Synalp, and to my fellow students of the NLP master, for the many discussions I had with them this year and the ones before, related or not to this project, because it's this atmosphere which led me into academia. 

Finally, I would like to thank the Loria for hosting me, even for a short time, and for they masterful crisis management.
I also to thank the Inria Project Lab (IPL) HyAIAI (``Hybrid Approaches for Interpretable AI'') for funding my research internship.
The experiments presented in my thesis were carried out using the Grid'5000 testbed, supported by a scientific interest group hosted by Inria and including CNRS, RENATER and several Universities as well as other organizations (see \url{https://www.grid5000.fr}).


%Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their love and encouragement, without which this thesis would not have been possible.

%Finally, we would like to thank ... for ... Covid-19.
