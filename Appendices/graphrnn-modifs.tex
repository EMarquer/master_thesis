\chapter{Modifications applied} % Main appendix title
\label{app:graphrnn-mods}

In this appendix we present some of the modifications we tested to improve the performance of the GraphRNN VAE.

\section{Sharing and Pre-Training the Node-Level Model}

\section{Stop Loss}
stop vector VS I/O vector
BCE on individual positions

\section{Pseudo-Transitive Closure Loss}
Pseudo-transitivity as a differential alternative to transitivity, instead of BCE
in practice, values are number of pathes between Top and this node

\section{Training the Decoder With or Without Gold Input}
provide expected sequence as a tensor, in a more standard seq2seq setting
